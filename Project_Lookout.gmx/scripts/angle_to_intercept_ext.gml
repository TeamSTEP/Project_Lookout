///angle_to_intercept_ext
/*  This script takes 8 arguments and returns the appropriate angle to aim in order to intercept a target.
    It is used to set the AI aiming
    Effectively the same as the basic angle_to_intercept script, however this one contains several
    additional variables for increased flexibility.
    
    Arguments:
        0 = Speed of the intercepting object in pixels/step
        1 = The starting x offset of the chasing instance relative to the calling instance
        2 = The starting y offset of the chasing instance relative to the calling instance
        3 = Instance ID to intercept
        4 = The x offset of the target origin to aim at (in case you don't want to aim directly at the origin)
        5 = The y offset of the target origin to aim at (in case you don't want to aim directly at the origin)
        6 = Boolean indicating whether you want the target offset to remain relative to the target (true - the point will rotate with the target), or to be globally oriented (false)
        7 = Boolean indicating whether to do the full calculation (true) or a faster approximation (false)
    
    This script must be called in the END STEP event as it uses the xprevious and yprevious variables. */
